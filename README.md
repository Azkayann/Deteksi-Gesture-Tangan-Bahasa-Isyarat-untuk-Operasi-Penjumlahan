✋ Hand Gesture Recognition for Sign Language-Based Addition using Computer Vision
This project is an educational computer vision system that detects and interprets two-hand gestures representing sign language numbers from 0 to 9, and performs real-time addition based on those gestures.

By leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system captures hand landmarks via webcam input, processes the gesture data, and displays the corresponding sum directly on the screen via a command-line interface. This project aims to explore how sign language and hand gestures can be integrated into intuitive, touchless computing interfaces.

🔍 Features
🖐️ Real-time detection of hand gestures using webcam

➕ Automatic addition of two numeric gestures (0–9)

✌️ Supports two-hand recognition simultaneously

📷 Built with custom gesture dataset tailored for numeric sign language

🛠️ Implemented using OpenCV and MediaPipe

💻 Lightweight, command-line interface (CLI) based system

🎓 Educational focus—ideal for learning about gesture recognition and computer vision

🎯 Use Case
The system demonstrates a proof-of-concept for gesture-based arithmetic input, particularly useful in educational settings or as a stepping stone for developing tools for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
